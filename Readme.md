#My Wallet
### An app to make your wallet smarter by eliminating the need to carry your IDs and stuff

We imagine a smart city in which no one has to carry anyting other than their phones and the phones 
should be able to replace everything you carry physically. My wallet is an attempt to replace your 
wallet by your smartphone by converting everything digitally while also ensuring the security of 
your stuff.
